# Reach
A variation on Sqore that is highly specialized for making games similar to Resident Evil 7 & 8 ("new RE").

The goal of reach is to make a very specific type of game relatively easy to make, while still being able to merge some improvements back into Sqore as it is developed. 
It is intended to be highly specific to my wants and needs. As such it will have many ergonomic features for creating things like items, cutscenes, and more.
